# promox-gtk
a proxmox client build with GTK3 to operate with spice guest.

[Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) is a complete open source server virtualization management software. You can access the guest by RDP/VNC/SPICE protocol.

Proxmox-GTK is GTK3 based, it can run on an very small linux box like [raspberry pi](https://raspberrypi.org). So you can throw your big, buzzing desktop personal computer away.
